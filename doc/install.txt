*** Installing TurboVNC for a Single User
#OPT: noList! plain!

Download the appropriate binary package, as above, then execute the following
commands:

	RPM-based systems :: {:}
	#Pverb <<---
	mkdir ~/turbovnc{nl}cd ~/turbovnc{nl}rpm2cpio __full/path/of/turbovnc*.rpm__ | cpio -idv
	---

	Debian-based systems :: {:}
	#Pverb <<---
	dpkg-deb --extract __full/path/of/turbovnc*.deb__ ~/turbovnc
	---

Add {file: ~/turbovnc} to any paths specified in this document.

	!!! If using the TurboVNC Session Manager, set the ''turbovnc.serverdir''
	Java system property in the TurboVNC Viewer to ''~/turbovnc/opt/TurboVNC'',
	or set the ''TVNC_SERVERDIR'' environment variable on the client machine to
	''\\~/turbovnc/opt/TurboVNC'' (note backslash.)  Refer to
	{ref prefix="Section ": TVNC_SERVERDIR}.

	!!! The TurboVNC security configuration file will not work when TurboVNC is
	installed in this manner.

** Installing the TurboVNC Viewer on macOS

	#. Download the TurboVNC Mac disk image
		({file: TurboVNC-{val: _VERSION}-x86_64.dmg} for Intel CPUs or
		{file: TurboVNC-{val: _VERSION}-arm64.dmg} for Apple silicon CPUs) from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc][TurboVNC SourceForge project page]].

	#. Open the disk image, then open {file: TurboVNC.pkg} inside the disk image.
		Follow the instructions to install the Mac TurboVNC Viewer.

** Installing the TurboVNC Viewer on Windows

	#. Download the TurboVNC Windows installer package
		({file: TurboVNC-{val: _VERSION}-x64.exe} for 64-bit systems or
		{file: TurboVNC-{val: _VERSION}-x86.exe} for legacy 32-bit-only systems)
		from the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc][TurboVNC SourceForge project page]].

		which you want the files to be installed.

** Installing TurboVNC from Source

If you are using a Linux/Un*x platform for which there is not a pre-built
TurboVNC binary package available, then download the TurboVNC source tarball

[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/files/][Files area]]
of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc][TurboVNC SourceForge project page]],
uncompress it, {pcode: cd turbovnc-{val: _VERSION}}, and read
{file: BUILDING.md} for further instructions on how to build TurboVNC from
source.
